# INLConfig

## 1. Overview

`INLConfig` is an iOS library for loading your configuration from a plist. Its goal is to have an easily maintainable configuration (by replacing things like global constants with a plist) without sacrificing productivity. After you add an item to the plist, you can start using it with autocomplete without doing any further configuration. This is achieved by a script that generates supporting code.
